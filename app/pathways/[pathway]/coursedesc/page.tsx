In this course, you will learn problem-solving strategies, software design, and the foundations of computer science. You'll do so using the Project STEM programming environment and Project Lead the Way CS Essentials curriculum. There are no prerequisites for this course, although you should have basic familiarity with how to operate a computer and use applications. It's also recommended that you have familiarity with basic algebra principles before starting this course."/>
